# Stepcraft GRBLizer

A GRBL compatible controller for use as a drop-in replacement for the SC100 USB standard controller deliverd with Stepcraft CNC machines. This Arduino Uno compatible controller is wired conforming the GRL v0.9+ standard. The controller can be used with the GRBL firmware and with EstlCAM. 

## Features
  - The PC is fully electrically isolated from the CNC machine (optional). 
	- Device is powered via the Stepcraft machine (not from USB port) and optionally from the ISP port.
  - All inputs protected with clamping diodes and resistors.
  - Probe inputs have a 100 Ohm / 10nF low pass filter to suppress spurious triggering. (Filter values may be experimented with.)
  - 3.5mm Jack for spindle / laser / hot-end control
  - 3.5mm Jack input for 2 probes.
  - Serial interface fed out the back (TTL, not protected). For people in a hurry: CP2102 and isolator ICs can be left unpopulated.
  - Standard 6 pin ISP programming connector fed out the back  (not protected).
  - Some juper block for IO-config

# Stepcraft 420 CNC settings with GRBLizer

Notes kindly provided by [Albin Stig√∂](https://github.com/ast) on getting [GRBL v1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki) working with the
[GRBLizer](https://github.com/eflukx/Stepcraft-GRBLizer) board.

Tested on Stepcraft 420, but probably works with most other Stepcraft types.

## Setup

* Stepcraft 420 CNC
* Stepcraft drivers with GRBLizer board
* [GRBL v1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki)
* [Universal-G-Code-Sender](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender)

Install GRBL in the usual way. However you need to make some changes in config.h and cpu_map.h.

```c
/* cpu_map.h */

// The Stepcraft has all limits on one pin.
#define X_LIMIT_BIT    1  // Uno Digital Pin 9
#define Y_LIMIT_BIT    1  // Uno Digital Pin 9
#define Z_LIMIT_BIT    1  // Uno Digital Pin 9
```

```c
/* config.h */

// Since all limit switches end up being shared on one pin, 
// we can only home one direction at a time.
#define HOMING_CYCLE_0 (1<<Z_AXIS)  // REQUIRED: First move Z to clear workspace.
#define HOMING_CYCLE_1 (1<<Y_AXIS)  // OPTIONAL: Then move X,Y at the same time.
#define HOMING_CYCLE_2 (1<<X_AXIS)  // OPTIONAL: Uncomment and add axes mask to enable

// The stop output of the Stepcraft board is inverted to what GRBL expects.
// However you simply can't swap the switch because the driver board will also
// disable the motors so nothing will move.
#define INVERT_CONTROL_PIN_MASK (1<<CONTROL_RESET_BIT) // Default disabled.
```

## GRBL settings

I haven't done a lot of fine tuning but these seems to work well enough.
